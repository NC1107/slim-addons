"""Launches every app in the catalogue, then answers each thing its scene offers, and checks every frame.

Usage: python3 scripts/check-app-scenes.py <run-module-binary>

A launch frame draws only what exists before anyone acts: word-guess has no text
ops until a guess, tic-tac-toe has no marks until a move. So from the launch
scene this takes every control, every distinct tap target and every input the
scene offers, sends each back as an action carrying the scene's own state, and
runs the reply through check-scene-ops too. The launch and the replies are sent
as two different callers, because seat-based modules answer an anonymous caller
with a refusal rather than a board.
