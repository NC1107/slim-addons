# slim-addons

The official module registry for [slim-m](https://github.com/Slim-m-org/slim-m).

A slim-m space installs modules from here through the Dock (space settings, admin only).
slim-m ships the module *system*; each module here ships its own behavior. See
slim-m's `docs/decisions/0021-modules-and-the-dock.md`.

## Layout

- `index.json` - the list the Dock browses.
- `modules/<id>/manifest.json` - one module's contract (permissions it adds, host
  capabilities it asks for, runtime backend it needs, and its artifact + sha256).
- `modules/<id>/<version>/module.wasm` - the built module artifact, pinned by version.

Nothing here runs until an admin installs it into a space, and then only with the
permissions and capabilities the admin approves.

## Building your own module

Start from [`modules/_template/`](modules/_template/) - a copyable starter that
builds as-is, with a text command, a slash command, and a launchable interactive
app. Its README walks through making it yours, and
[`scripts/package-module.sh`](scripts/package-module.sh) builds the wasm, places
it at its versioned path, and pins its SHA-256 into the manifest.

The full contract - the ABI, the manifest, every extension-point kind, the scene
contract, limits, and publishing - is in slim-m's
[`docs/modules/building-modules.md`](https://github.com/Slim-m-org/slim-m/blob/main/docs/modules/building-modules.md).

## Running a module before you install it

`tools/run-module` drives a module exactly the way slim does - same ABI, same
wasmi version, and the same refusal of a module that imports anything - so you
can see what yours actually emits without installing it into a space.

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path tools/run-module/Cargo.toml
R=tools/run-module/target/release/run-module

# a command, with its input
$R modules/spirograph/0.1.0/module.wasm spiro ''

# an interactive frame, the way a tap arrives
$R modules/spirograph/0.1.0/module.wasm spiro '{"action":"random","state":"34,13,21"}'
```

A module that needs to know who is acting gets a caller with `--caller <id>`:

```bash
$R --caller alice modules/tic-tac-toe/0.2.0/module.wasm play ''
```

`--fuel <n>` meters the run and fails it with `out of fuel` when the budget is spent, the way slim refuses a module over its limit.
The scripts below pass the manifest's `runtime.limits.fuel` and a timeout built from `wall_ms`.
Without `--fuel` the run is unmetered, and memory is never limited here, so a module that runs here can still be refused there for being too expensive.
The manifest's `runtime.limits` is the authority on that.

### Checking a scene against the renderer

If your module draws, `scripts/check-scene-ops.py` reads its output the way the
client's parser does and reports anything that would be silently dropped - an op
that does not exist, a key on the wrong op, a colour that is not a scene colour.
Pass it the runner, the wasm, the command, and as many inputs as you want
covered:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-scene-ops.py "$R" modules/spirograph/0.1.0/module.wasm spiro \
  '' '{"action":"random","state":"34,13,21"}' 'not json at all'
```

This is worth running on malformed input too. A scene op the client drops does
not fail loudly anywhere - it just does not draw - which is how three of these
shipped before the check existed.

## Checks

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request and push to main.
It runs `cargo test` for each module, `scripts/check-wasm-builds.py`, then `scripts/check-catalogue.py`, then `scripts/check-app-scenes.py`, which launches every app and checks the frame for each control, tap target and input its scene offers, as two different callers, then `scripts/check-command-modules.py`, which runs each command-only module through the wasm abi with a fixed input.
Right after the `cargo test` loop, `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'` runs the unit tests for these scripts and `cargo test` in `tools/run-module` runs the runner's own; `scripts/check-module-tests.py` fails a module whose `src` has no `#[test]`.

Each module keeps its logic in plain Rust with unit tests, so `cd modules/<id> && cargo test` runs them with no wasm involved.

`python3 scripts/check-catalogue.py` confirms every module has an `index.json` row that matches its manifest, that each pinned wasm still hashes to its `sha256`, and that every extension point names a permission and command the manifest declares.
With `--base origin/main` it also fails if a wasm that main already published was changed, or a manifest was edited without bumping its version.

`python3 scripts/check-wasm-builds.py` rebuilds each module's wasm with [`scripts/build-wasm.sh`](scripts/build-wasm.sh) and fails if it differs from the one the manifest pins, so a source change cannot ship without a rebuilt wasm and a new version.
The build uses the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and remaps every absolute path (cargo home, toolchain, checkout) to a fixed one, so the same source gives the same bytes on any machine.
`scripts/package-module.sh` uses the same recipe.
Rustup reads the pin automatically; a machine without that exact toolchain installed needs `rustup toolchain install 1.94.1` first.

Wasm files published before that recipe cannot match a rebuild.
They are listed in `scripts/wasm-unreproduced.txt`, which only shrinks: rebuild a module with `scripts/package-module.sh`, bump its version, and delete its line.
For a listed module, CI on a pull request instead fails a change to `src/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` or `.cargo/` that keeps the version.
